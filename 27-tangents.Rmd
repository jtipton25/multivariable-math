# Tangent planes and linear approximations

Let $f(\mathbf{x})$ be a differentiable function at a point $\mathbf{a}$. Because the function is differentiable at $\mathbf{a}$, this means that all paths $P_\mathbf{a}$ that approach the point $\mathbf{a}$ from all directions all take on values $f(P_\mathbf{a})$ that are "close" to $f(\mathbf{a})$. Mathematically, we describe this as **smoothness**. A more explicit description says that as the paths $P_{\mathbf{a}$ get very close to $\mathbf{a}$, the space over which these paths are defined starts to look more and more like a flat surface--the **tangent plane**.
