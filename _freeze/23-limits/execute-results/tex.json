We will start with a discussion of functions of two variables (although the functions are not assumed to be linear). We define a function of two variables explicitly as $z = f(x, y)$. \n\n::: {#def-}\nLike with linear functions, we can define the domain and range for general functions of two variables. A function $f(x, y)$ assigns each point $(x, y)$ in some **domain** $\\mathcal{D}$ in $\\mathcal{R}^2$ to a unique number $z$ in a subset of $\\mathcal{R}$. The set of inputs $\\mathcal{D}$ is called the **domain** of the function and the **range** is the set of real numbers $z$ that are the output of the function over all the inputs in $\\mathcal{D}$\n:::\n\n\n::: {#exm-}\nLet $f(x, y) = \\sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$. \n\n* The domain of $f$ is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1$ which is the unit circle (**draw picture**).\n\n* The range is the unit interval $[0, 1]$\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Graphs and level curves\n\n::: {#exm-}\nThe parabola\n\nConsider the function of two variables \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(x, y) = x^2 + y^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nwhich defines the surface\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](23-limits_files/figure-pdf/example-parabola-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe 3-dimensional surface can be represented in 2-dimensions using level curves (think of a topographic map)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata.frame(expand.grid(x, y)) %>%\n    rename(x = Var1, y = Var2) %>%\n    mutate(z = parabola(x, y)) %>%\n    ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, z = z)) +\n    geom_contour() +\n    coord_fixed(ratio = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](23-limits_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nwhere each curve in the (x, y) plane has exactly the same value of $f(x, y)$.

For now, we focus on two variable functions as the multivariable case follows similar from the two variable case.\n\nLet $P(x, y) \\rightarrow P_0(a, b)$ be a path in the $x-y$ plane that starts at the point $P(x, y)$ and ends at the point $P_0(a, b)$ with coordinates $(a, b)$. Thus, we can understand the limit as the fixed value of $f(x, y)$ for which all paths that connect the points $P(x, y)$ that are \"close\" to $P_0(a, b)$ converge to. \n\nFor one-dimensional limits, \"close\" was defined as distance. Thus, for multivariable functions, \"close\" is defined as the Euclidean distance defined by a \"ball\" of radius $\\delta$ and the limits examines the function output as the radius $\\delta$ goes to 0.\n\nRecall that the distance $dist((x, y), (a, b))$ between two points $(x, y)$ and $(a, b)$ is \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ndist((x, y), (a, b)) = \\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\n** Draw images**\n\n\n::: {#def-}\n## Limit of a Function of Two Variables\nThe function f(x, y) has limit $L$ as $P(x, y) \\rightarrow P_0(a, b)$, written\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (a, b)} f(x, y) = \\lim_{P \\rightarrow P_0} f(x, y) = L,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nif, for any $\\epsilon > 0$ (the radius of the ball that defines the \"closeness\" of the point), there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n|f(x, y) - L| < \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nwhenever $(x, y)$ is in the domain of $f$ and \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 < \\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2} < \\delta.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n:::\n\nIn the definition, as the value of $\\delta$ is getting smaller, the distance between the set of points $P(x, y)$ within radius $\\delta$ of the point $P_0(a, b)$ is getting smaller. As a consequence, the limit in the definition above exists only if $f(x, y)$ approaches the value $L$ along **all possible paths** in the domain of $f$. \n\n::: {#exm-}\nIn class notes\n* **Future work: write out hand-written examples**\n:::\n\n\n:::{#thm-}\nLet $L$ and $M$ be real numbers and let $\\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (a, b)}f(x, y) = L$ and $\\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (a, b)}g(x, y) = M$ for functions $f(x, y)$ and $g(x, y)$.

Mathematically, a point $P$ is an interior point of $\\mathcal{D}$ if it is possible to define a ball of radius $\\epsilon>0$ centered at $P$ such that this ball only contains points within $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n* A **boundary** point $P$ of $\\mathcal{D}$ is a point that lies on the edge of the region $\\mathcal{D}$. Mathematically, a point $P$ is an boundary point of $\\mathcal{D}$ if every ball of radius $\\epsilon>0$ centered at $P$ contains at least one point in $\\mathcal{D}$ and one point outside $\\mathcal{D}$.\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-}\nLet $f(x, y) = \\sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$. The boundary points are all the points on the unit circle an the interior points are all the points on the interior of the unit disk. **draw picture**\n:::\n\n::: {#def-}\nA region $\\mathcal{D}$ is said to be **open** if it only contains interior points (i.e., $\\mathcal{D}$ has no boundary points). A region $\\mathcal{D}$ is said to be **closed** if the region contains all its boundary points. \n:::\n\n**Figure: limit paths along the boundary**\n\n::: {#exm-}\nConsider the $\\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (4, 4)} \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{x - y}$. Because the point $(4, 4)$ is not a valid point in the domain (can't divide by $4-4=0$), the point $(4, 4)$ is a boundary point of the domain. The boundary of the domain that is not contained in the domain is the set of points $x = y$. Assuming we are not taking a path along the boundary, we know that $x \\neq y$ in the interior of the domain. Hence, \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (4, 4)} \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{x - y} & = \\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (4, 4)} \\frac{(x - y)(x + y)}{x - y} \\\\\n& = \\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (4, 4)} x + y  = 4 + 4 = 8\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nfor all paths that do not cross the line $y = x$.\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-}\n**nonexistence of limit in class**\n:::\n\n## Continuity\nA very important property of functions is continuity. In a general sense, a function is continuous if two nearby input values result in nearby output values. As a graph, this means that there are no hops, skips, or jumps.\n\n::: {#def-}\nThe function $f(x, y)$ is said to be continuous at the point $(a, b)$ if the following are true\n\n1) $f(a, b)$ is defined at $(a, b)$\n\n2) $\\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (a, b)} f(x, y)$ exists\n\n3) $\\lim_{(x, y) \\rightarrow (a, b)} f(x, y) = f(a, b)$ \n:::\n\n::: {#exm-}\n**checking continuity in class**\n$f(x, y) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{x^2 - y^2}{x - y} & \\mbox{ if } x \\neq y \\\\\nx + y & \\mbox{ if } x = y \\\\\n\\end{cases}$\n:::\n\n\n\n\n",
