# Linear independence {#linear-independence}

Recall the homogeneous equation $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ can be written as a linear combination of coefficients $x_1, \ldots, x_K$ and vectors $\mathbf{a}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_K$ where 
$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^K x_k \mathbf{a}_k = \mathbf{0}
\end{align*}
$$
```{definition} 
The set of vectors $\mathbf{a}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_K$ are called **linearly independent** if the only solution to the vector equation $\sum_{k=1}^K x_k \mathbf{a}_k = \mathbf{0}$ is the trivial solution. The set of vectors $\mathbf{a}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_K$ are called **linearly dependent** if there are coefficients $x_1, \ldots, x_K$ that are not all zero.

What does it mean for a set of vectors to be **linearly dependent**? This means that there is at least one vector $\mathbf{a}_k$ that can be written as a sum of the other vectors with coefficients $x_k$:
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}_k = \sum_{j \neq k} x_{j} \mathbf{a}_{j}
\end{align*}
$$
Note: **linear dependence** does not imply that all vectors $\mathbf{a}_{k}$ can be written as a linear combination of other vectors, just that there is at least one such vector in the set.

```{theorem} 
The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has linearly independent columns if and only if the matrix equation $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution.
```

**Example: in class** A set of a single vector

**Example:  in class** A set of two vectors

* linearly independent if:

* linearly dependent if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other:

```{theorem}
If an $n \times K$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has $K > n$, then the columns of $\mathbf{A}$ are linearly dependent. In other words, if a set of vectors $\mathbf{a}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_K$ contains more vectors than entries within vectors, the set of vectors is linearly dependent.
```

```{proof}
If $K>n$, there are more variables ($K$) than equations ($n$). Therefore, there is at least one free variable and this implies that the homogeneous equation $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$ has a non-trivial solution \@ref(eq:homogeneous)
```


```{theorem}
If a set of vectors $\mathbf{a}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_K$ contains the $\mathbf{0}$ vector, then the the set of vectors is linearly dependent.
