<p>In general, we talk about finding either minimums or maximum values of a function. For simplicity, we focus here on finding the minimum value of a function <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> because finding the maximum value of <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> is equivalent to finding the minimum value of <span class="math inline">\(-f(\cdot)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To characterize these minimum values, we consider two different types of minimums: local minimums and global minimums. For now, we focus on functions of two variables but these ideas are similar for functions of many variables.</p>
<div id="local-minimums" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.1</span> Local minimums</h2>
<p>A local minimum of the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> is a point <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> where the values of the function <span class="math inline">\(f(a, b)\)</span> evaluated at <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> is less than or equal to the function <span class="math inline">\(f(a + \Delta x, b + \Delta y)\)</span> at any nearby point <span class="math inline">\((a + \Delta x, b + \Delta y)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta y\)</span> are very small values.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:unnamed-chunk-300" class="definition"><strong>Definition 29.1  </strong></span>Let <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> be a point in the domian <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> of the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span>. If there exists an <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\|(x, y) - (a, b)\| &lt; \epsilon\)</span> (the point <span class="math inline">\((x, y)\)</span> is close to the point <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> for a given disk of radius <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> at the point <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>), then if <span class="math inline">\(f(a, b) \leq f(x, y)\)</span>, the point <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> is called a <strong>local minimum</strong> value of the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span>.
</div>

<p>In terms of finding a minimum of a surface, the local minimum is any point on the surface from which one cannot walk downhill if one can only take small steps. Like in univariate functions, local minimums also have a relationship to the partial derivatives.</p>

<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:unnamed-chunk-301" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 29.1  </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> has a local minimum at the point <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> is a differentiable function at <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>, then the partial derivatives <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial f(x, y)}{\partial x}|_{(a, b)} = f_x(a, b) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial f(x, y)}{\partial y}|_{(a, b)} = f_y(a, b) = 0\)</span>
</div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the converse is not necessarily true: just because <span class="math inline">\(f_x(a, b) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_y(a, b) = 0\)</span>, this doesn’t mean that we have a minimum point at <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>.</p>
<p>As stated above, the fact that the partial derivatives <span class="math inline">\(f_x(a, b) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_y(a, b) = 0\)</span> does not imply that the point <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> is a local minimum. Instead, the partial derivatives being 0 only implies that <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> is a critical point of the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span>.</p>

<p>If a critical point isn’t a local minimum/maximum, what else could this point be? One possible shape is what is called a saddle point. A saddle point is one in which the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> is increasing in one direction (say, along the x-axis) and decreasing along another direction (say, the y-axis). The surface is often said to resemble the shape of a saddle (or a Pringles chip). An example saddle point is shown in the plot below.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.2</span> Global maximums and minimums</h2>
<p>We have shown how you can find critical points <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> by finding points that have 0 partial derivatives in each direction (<span class="math inline">\(f_x(a, b) = f_y(a, b) = 0\)</span>) and we have shown how to characterize these critical points using the second derivative test. In data science, we are often interested in finding the “best” model, not just the “best local” model. So a question arises is whether the local minima/maxima that we find are the global minima/maxima. To determine this, we have to define the global minima/maxima.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:unlabeled-div-320" class="definition"><strong>Definition 29.4  </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> is a function defined over a domain (or a subset of the domain) <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{R}^2\)</span> that contains the point <span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span>, we say</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> is a <strong>global maximum</strong> if <span class="math inline">\(f(a, b) \geq f(x, y)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\((x, y) \in \mathcal{D}\)</span> and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((a, b)\)</span> is a <strong>global minimum</strong> if <span class="math inline">\(f(a, b) \leq f(x, y)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\((x, y) \in \mathcal{D}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Thus, once you have found all the critical points, you also need to check all the boundary points for the domain (or subdomain) <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> as the global minimum/maximum might lie on the boundary.</p>
<p>In general finding the global maximum/minimum points can be done by applying the following procedure:</p>
<div>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> be a function on a closed (the set contains its boundary points) and bounded (the set is not infinite) set. Then, the global minima/maxima can be found by</p>

<li><p>Finding the minimum/maximum of the set of function values from 1) and 2).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-321" class="example"><strong>Example 29.4  </strong></span>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) = x^2 - 4xy + y^2\)</span> over the region <span class="math inline">\([-2,2]\times[-2, 2]\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>In data science problems, it is often difficult to analyze the functions analytically (using the tools of calculus directly). Instead, one can use numeric techniques to find minima and maxima. Two techniques that we will discuss are grid search and gradient descent.</p>
</div>
<div id="grid-search-optimization" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">29.3</span> Grid search optimization</h2>
<p>If the number of input variables in the function is small, one can find global minima and maxima using grid search. To find a global minima/maxima in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{R}^2\)</span>, one creates a grid over the domain <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}\)</span> and evaluates the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y)\)</span> at these grid points and finds the numerical solution.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:unlabeled-div-322" class="example"><strong>Example 29.5  </strong></span>Let <span class="math inline">\(f(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2\)</span> over the region <span class="math inline">\([-2,2]\times[-2, 2]\)</span></p>

<!-- ### Arrays -->
<!-- Higher order arrays (for example, tensors in the tensorflow library) can be represented using subscript notation where $[\mathbf{A}_1 | \mathbf{A}_2 | \cdots \mathbf{A}_n]$ is a 3-dimensional array. Higher order arrays can be represented using additional subscripts. -->
<!-- ### Lists -->
<!-- * To add: vector addition, multiplication -->
<!-- * To add: matrix addition, multiplication -->
<!-- * To add: determinants -->
<!-- ## Exercises -->
<!-- 1) What is 3 + $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$? -->
<!-- 2) Why can't you add the following two vectors: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- \mathbf{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 14 \\ 3 \\ 3 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} & & \mathbf{y} =  \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- 3) Based on the notation, what type of object is  -->
<!--     a) $\mathbf{x}'$? -->
<!--     b) $\mathbf{x}' \mathbf{y}$? -->
<!--     c) $\mathbf{x}' \mathbf{A}$? -->
<!--     d) $\mathbf{A}' \mathbf{y}$? -->
<!--     e) $\mathbf{X}' \mathbf{Z}$? -->
<!-- You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods). -->
<!-- Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively. -->
<!-- ```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'} -->
<!-- par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) -->
<!-- plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab). -->
<!-- ```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::kable( -->
<!--   head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!', -->
<!--   booktabs = TRUE -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. -->
